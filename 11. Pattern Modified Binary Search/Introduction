Introduction
As we know, whenever we are given a sorted Array or LinkedList or Matrix, and we are asked to find a certain element, the best algorithm we can use is the Binary Search.

This pattern describes an efficient way to handle all problems involving Binary Search. We will go through a set of problems that will help us build an understanding of this pattern so that we can apply this technique to other problems we might come across in the interviews.

Letâ€™s start with our first problem.
